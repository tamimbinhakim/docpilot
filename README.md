> **Status:** v0.1 implementation shipped — 12 MCP tools, GitHub + GitLab + Bitbucket forges, a plug-in registry for new forges / lockfiles / registries.

</div>

<br />

## What it does

Add docpilot to your MCP client — it runs as a local stdio server:

```bash
npx -y docpilot
```

Configure it in any MCP-capable client (Claude Code, Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, VS Code, Codex CLI). Then in chat, you say things like _"show me the routing docs from `vercel/next.js@v15.0.0`"_ — and your model calls docpilot, docpilot fetches the actual file from the actual repo at the actual version, returns it as markdown, and your model gets to work with information it can trust.

It also resolves fuzzy names — `"drizzle orm"` → `drizzle-team/drizzle-orm` via npm/PyPI/crates/Go/RubyGems/Packagist/Hex — and can search across your whole project's deps in one call (`search_all`).

What you get out of the box:

- **Local-first.** Cache, index, and fetch all run on your machine. No telemetry, no analytics. Your query strings never leave.
- **Any public repo on GitHub, GitLab, or Bitbucket.** The forge layer is a plug-in registry, so Codeberg / Gitea / sourcehut are one file away.
- **Version-pinned by default.** `owner/repo@v15.0.0` is the path of least resistance, not a power-user feature you'll forget about.
- **Free, forever.** Bring your own GitHub PAT — or none. ETag 304s don't count against your rate limit, so a warm cache is effectively unlimited.
- **Markdown out, not JSON.** ~75% smaller for the same information. Every response self-reports `~tokens` so the model can budget.
- **No third-party instruction channel.** No registry can author content delivered through docpilot. The [ContextCrush class of bug](https://noma.security/) cannot exist here, structurally.

<br />

## Why not Context7

Context7 is the elephant in the room and the reason I felt the need to write this section at all. It's the default people reach for, it's well-marketed, and it solved a real problem — for a while. But the parts that broke for me aren't bugs. They're properties of the architecture. (The personal version of how I hit each of these is in [The story](#the-story) below.)

|                                        | Context7                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      | docpilot                                                                                                                                                                     |
| -------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Prompt-injection surface**           | Custom Rules served verbatim from the registry into the agent's trusted channel — see the [ContextCrush disclosure (Noma Security, Feb 2026)](https://noma.security/). The patch fixed the bug; the registry-as-instruction-channel **architecture remains**. | None. docpilot returns only file contents from `github.com/{owner}/{repo}` that you explicitly named. Period.                                                                |
| **Trust boundary**                     | Upstash registry + third-party-authored Custom Rules.                                                                                                                                                                                                         | Your GitHub PAT. The public CDN. That's it.                                                                                                                                  |
| **Privacy**                            | Every query is sent to `context7.com`. Your phrasing is a third-party signal.                                                                                                                                                                                 | Your queries never leave your machine. Outbound calls go only to GitHub, jsDelivr, and the public package registries — and the registries only when you call `resolve_repo`. |
| **Free-tier capacity**                 | Cut **83–92% in Jan 2026**. Many users hit caps within an afternoon of work.                                                                                                                                                                                  | Free, forever. Your rate limit is your own GitHub PAT (5,000/hr) — and authenticated `If-None-Match` 304s don't count, so a warm cache is effectively unlimited.             |
| **Library coverage**                   | Curated registry. If it's not in Context7, you're out of luck.                                                                                                                                                                                                | Any public GitHub repo. If `owner/repo` exists on GitHub, docpilot can serve it — including the libraries _you_ just shipped.                                                |
| **Wrong-library hallucination**        | `resolve-library-id` will silently route an unknown name to a "similar" library based on opaque trust scores. Multiple "library not found" and silent-mismatch reports on r/cursor and HN.                                                                    | `resolve_repo` is transparent: npm/PyPI/crates first, GitHub stars last. Returns the candidate list when ambiguous and lets you (or the model) pick.                         |
| **Version pinning UX**                 | Possible (`/owner/lib/vX.Y.Z`) but most users don't bother.                                                                                                                                                                                                   | First-class. `owner/repo@ref` _is_ the canonical input format.                                                                                                               |
| **Freshness**                          | Periodic re-index. Per their own guide: _"very recent releases — within days — may not be available yet."_                                                                                                                                                    | Your cache. ETag-revalidate-on-read means at most one round-trip stale. Pin `@main` for HEAD; pin `@v1.2.3` for reproducibility.                                             |
| **Token bloat**                        | Returns large JSON-flavored payloads. r/cursor users complain it eats the context window.                                                                                                                                                                     | Markdown trees and frontmatter, ~75% smaller than equivalent JSON. Every response includes `~tokens: N` so the model can budget.                                             |
| **"Use context7" magic trigger**       | Required for the model to reach for it; otherwise it doesn't fire.                                                                                                                                                                                            | Tool descriptions are written so the model **defaults** to docpilot when you mention a library. No incantation.                                                              |
| **Account / API key for higher quota** | Yes. Privacy-conscious users opt out.                                                                                                                                                                                                                         | None. There is no account. There is nothing to log into.                                                                                                                     |
| **Monorepos**                          | Limited. `/vercel/next.js` returns "Next.js docs," not arbitrary `packages/*/docs/`.                                                                                                                                                                          | First-class `#subpath`: `vercel/next.js@canary#packages/next/src/lib`.                                                                                                       |
| **Your own libraries during dev**      | Has to be ingested first. New releases lag.                                                                                                                                                                                                                   | Works the second you push to GitHub. Pin `@<sha>` and your model is reading the diff you just shipped.                                                                       |

Context7's strengths — curation, hosted indexing, smart ranking — are precisely the surface area where it fails in ways docpilot **structurally cannot**. That's the whole pitch.

<br />

## The story

I built docpilot because I got tired of doing the same dance every day.

I'd been elbows-deep in two of my own libraries — [`tamimbinhakim/imprint-pdf`](https://github.com/tamimbinhakim/imprint-pdf) and [`tamimbinhakim/dyadpy`](https://github.com/tamimbinhakim/dyadpy) — refactoring APIs faster than I could ship them. The repos were the source of truth for what the libraries did. They had to be. I was the one writing the docs.

Then I'd open a _different_ project to actually use those libraries — to dogfood them, see if the API I'd just shipped was any good. And the AI in that editor was, predictably, useless about my libraries. Of course it was. Its training data was months old, and even if it weren't, my last refactor was twenty minutes ago. So it would politely hallucinate an API that hadn't existed since last Tuesday, and I'd waste a turn correcting it.

So I'd do the dance:

1. Open the library's repo in another tab.
2. Find `llms-full.txt` — and hope I'd remembered to regenerate it after the rename.
3. Paste it into the chat. Watch a third of my context window evaporate on docs the model would have ignored half of anyway.
4. Repeat tomorrow because I'd shipped another breaking change at 1 AM.

I tried Context7. It's well-built and the team clearly cares. But its registry doesn't know about my libraries until it crawls them, and by their own admission, _"very recent releases — within days — may not be available yet."_ My library changed thirty minutes ago. I needed _now_, not within-days. And I didn't love that every query phrased the way I phrased it was sailing off to a third-party service so it could decide which "trust-scored" library to feed back to my model.

The fix turned out to be obvious in hindsight: **the canonical source for a library's docs is its git repo**. So pull straight from there. Pin to a commit sha for reproducibility, pin to `@main` for HEAD. ETag-revalidate so repeat reads cost zero against your rate limit. Cache locally. No middleman. No registry. No account.

That's docpilot. It's the tool I wanted on my own machine, six months ago.

<br />

## Quick Start

### 1. Add docpilot to your MCP client

**Claude Desktop / Claude Code** (`~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` on macOS, `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` on Windows):

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "docpilot": {
      "command": "npx",
      "args": ["-y", "docpilot"],
      "env": {
        "GITHUB_TOKEN": "ghp_…optional but recommended"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

**Cursor** (`~/.cursor/mcp.json`), **Windsurf**, and **VS Code** (`mcp.servers`) take the same shape.

**Codex CLI:**

```bash
codex mcp add docpilot -- npx -y docpilot
```

**Windows note:** `npx` is a shim, not an `.exe`, and several MCP clients fail with `spawn npx ENOENT`. Use the explicit shell wrapper:

```jsonc
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "docpilot": {
      "command": "cmd",
      "args": ["/c", "npx", "-y", "docpilot"]
    }
  }
}
```

Run `npx -y docpilot doctor` once to verify your environment.

### 2. Use it from your assistant

Reference any GitHub repo as `owner/repo[@ref][#subpath]`:

```text
"Set up Drizzle ORM with Postgres in Next.js 15 server actions"
"Show me the routing docs from vercel/next.js@v15.0.0"
"Search tailwindlabs/tailwindcss@main for 'arbitrary values'"
"Use the latest tamimbinhakim/dyadpy@main API to wire up an SSE endpoint"
```

The model picks the right tool from the docpilot surface — `resolve_repo`, `list_docs`, `search_docs`, `fetch_doc`, `peek`, `get_changes`, `doc_quality`, `cache_status` — automatically. No magic incantation.

<br />

## Repo parameter format

A single string. Optionally compound:

```text
[forge:]owner/repo[@ref][#subpath]
```

```ts
vercel/next.js                                          // main HEAD, repo root (default forge: GitHub)
vercel/next.js@v15.0.0                                  // tagged release
vercel/next.js@canary                                   // branch
vercel/next.js@a3b1f7c                                  // commit sha (short or full)
tailwindlabs/tailwindcss@main#packages/tailwindcss/docs // monorepo docs subtree
python/cpython@3.13#Doc                                 // only the Doc/ tree
gitlab:gitlab-org/gitlab@master                         // GitLab (alias: gl:)
bitbucket:atlassian/python-bitbucket                    // Bitbucket Cloud (alias: bb:)
```

See [`docs/reference/repo-spec.md`](docs/reference/repo-spec.md) for the full grammar.

<br />

## Tools

```ts
resolve_repo  // "drizzle orm" → drizzle-team/drizzle-orm via npm/PyPI/crates first, GitHub last.
              // Suggests `npm install …` when the dep is missing from your lockfile.
list_docs     // Markdown tree of docs files, with size hints, freshness badges, llms.txt highlights.
              // Optional `since: "2025-04-01"` filter for "what changed since the model's cutoff?".
fetch_doc     // One file with frontmatter metadata + one-paragraph summary. Supports `lines` /
              // `head_bytes` for partial reads.
search_docs   // BM25+ search across the snapshot (per-repo MiniSearch index, cached by commit sha).
search_all    // Fan-out search across many repos at once. Pass `repos: [...]` or `from_lockfile: true`.
peek          // First N lines of a file before committing to a full fetch.
get_changes   // Unified diff for one file across two refs.
changelog     // Slice CHANGELOG.md / HISTORY.md between two refs.
related_repos // Scrape README + llms.txt for github.com peer links — "often used with…".
get_issues    // Search a repo's issues and PRs for a query (separate /search/issues, 30/min).
doc_quality   // Scorecard: llms.txt, README, framework nav (Docusaurus / Mintlify / VitePress /
              // Nextra / Fern), last-touch age.
cache_status  // Diagnostic: cache hits, sizes, snapshot sha, last revalidate.
```

### CLI surface

```text
docpilot                          Start the MCP stdio server (default)
docpilot doctor                   Environment self-check
docpilot warm <spec...>           Pre-pull trees + indexes for repos or a recipe
docpilot recipe install <path>    Pre-warm from a recipe file
docpilot cache status [repo]      On-disk cache report
docpilot cache gc                 Garbage-collect the cache
docpilot --version | --help
```

<br />

## Configuration

Discovery (highest precedence first):

1. CLI args to `docpilot`
2. `.docpilot.toml` in cwd or any ancestor up to `$HOME`
3. `~/.config/docpilot/config.toml`
4. Env vars
5. Built-in defaults

A starter config:

```toml
[cache]
dir       = "~/.cache/docpilot"

## Recipes

A "recipe" is a shareable bundle of pre-pinned repos. Pre-warm the cache for a stack with one command:

```bash
npx -y docpilot recipe install ./.docpilot.recipe.toml
```

```toml
# .docpilot.recipe.toml
[[repo]]
spec  = "vercel/next.js@v15.0.0"
alias = "next"

[[repo]]
spec  = "drizzle-team/drizzle-orm@v0.30.1"
alias = "drizzle"

[[repo]]
spec  = "clerk/javascript@v5#packages/clerk-js"
alias = "clerk"
```

Recipe authoring: [`docs/guides/recipes.md`](docs/guides/recipes.md). Browse community recipes: [`examples/recipes/`](examples/recipes/).

<br />

## Privacy

docpilot makes no network call to any host other than:

- `api.github.com`, `cdn.jsdelivr.net`
- `gitlab.com`, `api.bitbucket.org` (only when you use a `gitlab:` or `bitbucket:` repo spec)
- `registry.npmjs.org`, `pypi.org`, `crates.io`, `rubygems.org`, `repo.packagist.org`, `pkg.go.dev`, `hex.pm` (only when `resolve_repo` is called)

No telemetry. No analytics. Your query strings never leave your machine except as the URL path of those documented hosts.

## Development

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tamimbinhakim/docpilot.git
cd docpilot
pnpm install
pnpm build
pnpm test
pnpm dev          # runs docpilot from source
```

Conventions and CI gates live in [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md). The repo uses:

- **TypeScript** for runtime code (Node ≥20)
- **oxlint** + **oxfmt** for JS / TS lint and format
- **prettier** for markdown only
- **ruff** for Python (`scripts/`)
- **commitlint** with [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/)
- **changesets** for versioning and releases
- **vitest** for unit and integration tests
- **husky** + **lint-staged** for pre-commit gates
