# ctxpeek

## 0.1.2

### Patch Changes

- Fix release hygiene for the MCP package: report the runtime version from package metadata, make the MCP boot integration test wait for server readiness, ship the full Apache license in the npm tarball, and expand the npm README with the Context7 vs ctxpeek agent-flow explanation.

## 0.1.1

### Patch Changes

- [#17](https://github.com/tamimbinhakim/ctxpeek/pull/17) [`8de308d`](https://github.com/tamimbinhakim/ctxpeek/commit/8de308dcfb5e852d83b6241fe552fa65ec16f055) Thanks [@tamimbinhakim](https://github.com/tamimbinhakim)! - Remove the auto-generated `summary` field from `fetch_doc` frontmatter.

  The summary was a local extractive build (lead-sentence-of-top-N-sections by
  length, no model call). In practice it:
  - Added a parallel, lower-quality restatement of content the assistant was
    about to read in full anyway — pure context noise.
  - Truncated mid-word on long sections, producing garbled fragments like
    "build the espace:" (clipped from "build the namespace:").
  - Lived in a YAML envelope without proper multi-line/folded quoting, so a
    long summary could leave an unterminated `"` and bleed into the doc body,
    corrupting the frame Claude (or any client) was parsing.

  `fetch_doc` now returns just `repo / ref / commit / path / size / source /
~tokens` in frontmatter, then the doc body. If a summary is ever
  reintroduced, it should be model-generated and rendered outside the YAML
  frame (or properly block-quoted with `|`).

## 0.0.0

Initial scaffold and pre-release package metadata.
