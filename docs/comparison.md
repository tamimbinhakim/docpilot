# Comparison: docpilot vs Context7 vs GitMCP vs Ref Tools

A direct, non-marketing comparison.

| Property | docpilot | Context7 | GitMCP | Ref Tools |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Transport | stdio (local) | stdio + HTTP (hosted) | stdio + HTTP (hosted) | stdio (local) |
| Account required | No | Optional, recommended for higher quota | Optional | No |
| Trust boundary | Your GitHub PAT, public CDN | Upstash registry + Custom Rules surface | Hosted; user-trusted | Local |
| Data freshness | ETag-revalidated on read; min round-trip | Periodic re-index; days lag on new releases | On-demand fetch | On-demand |
| Library coverage | Any public GitHub repo | Curated registry | Any public GitHub repo | Configured docs sets |
| Version pinning | `owner/repo@ref` first-class | `/owner/lib/vX.Y.Z` slash form | Limited | Per-source |
| Privacy | Query strings never leave your machine | Every query → context7.com | Query → gitmcp.io | Local |
| Prompt-injection vector | None (no third-party instruction channel) | Patched ContextCrush; structural concern remains | Hosted; theoretical | Minimal |
| Cost | Free, your rate limits | Free tier + paid tiers | Free | Free |
| Response format | Markdown by default | JSON-flavored text payloads | Markdown | Markdown |
| Token efficiency | Tree+frontmatter; self-reports cost | Larger; users report bloat | Medium | Tight |
| Offline cache | Yes, content-addressed | No (hosted) | No (hosted) | Partial |
| Fuzzy name resolution | npm/PyPI/crates first, GitHub last | Internal trust-scored registry | URL-based | N/A |
| Monorepo subpath | First-class `#subpath` | Limited | Limited | N/A |
| Code search | Not in scope (use github-mcp-server) | Code snippets included | Code search | No |
| License (server) | Apache-2.0 | Custom (npm package MIT; service ToS bind) | MIT | Closed/freemium |

## When to pick which

- **docpilot** — you want local-first, version-pinned, registry-free reads of any public repo, and you are OK supplying a GitHub PAT for higher throughput.
- **Context7** — you want a hosted, curated, "it just works" experience, and the trust posture and registry coverage are acceptable for your use case.
- **GitMCP** — you want a hosted equivalent of "give me docs from owner/repo" without local install, and you're OK with that trust boundary.
- **Ref Tools** — you want narrowly-scoped, hand-curated docs sets per project (e.g., your team's internal notes plus a fixed set of vendor docs).

These are not strictly substitutes — running docpilot alongside Context7 or Ref Tools is fine. The MCP transport is shared; the model picks per call.

## What docpilot is not

- A source-code-understanding tool. For symbol-level navigation, use [`github-mcp-server`](https://github.com/github/github-mcp-server) or [`deepwiki`](https://deepwiki.com).
- A hosted SaaS. Architectural decision; if we run a server, we become Context7.
- A vector index in v1. BM25+ is good enough for docs corpora typically ≤10 MB per repo. Vectors are an opt-in v0.3+ experiment.
- A curated library registry. We will never maintain a "trusted libraries" list. If a library has a public GitHub repo, docpilot can read it.
- A read-write tool. No `create_issue`, no `commit`, no `pr`. Adjacent to scope.
